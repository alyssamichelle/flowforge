# Flowforge ⚙️

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.3.9.


**Flowforge** is a visual workflow composer built with Angular and Kendo UI.  
It lets you drag, connect, and configure actions—like “Send Email” or “Post to Slack”—to design end-to-end automation flows with accessibility and style baked in.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Flowforge turns process logic into something you can see and shape.

- 🎨 **Visual Layout** — Sidebar of draggable nodes, central canvas for connections, and a properties panel for configuration.  
- 🧠 **Smart UI Generation** — Built using the Telerik & Kendo UI MCP Tools (AI UI Generator).  
- ♿ **Accessible by Default** — Semantic structure, visible focus indicators, and WCAG-compliant contrast.  
- 🌗 **Theme-Aware** — Light and dark mode support out of the box.  
- 🔗 **Pluggable Nodes** — Easily extend the library of workflow steps with your own actions or integrations.

## 🧱 Architecture



## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
